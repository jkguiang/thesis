    This dissertation presents the analyses of WH and VVH production through vector boson scattering (VBS). 
    The VBS WH analysis excludes scenarios where the HWW and HZZ couplings have opposite signs beyond 5 standard deviations. 
    The VBS VVH analysis places limits on the value of the HHVV coupling between -0.03 and 2.04. 
    Both analyses are based on proton-proton collision data recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC from 2016 to 2018 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. 
    In addition, two projects for the high luminosity LHC upgrade are described: a highly parallelizable track-finding algorithm and managed networking for large-scale data science.
