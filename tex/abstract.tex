    This dissertation presents the analyses of WH and VVH production through vector boson scattering (VBS). 
    The VBS WH analysis excludes scenarios where the HWW and HZZ couplings have opposite signs beyond 5 standard deviations. 
    The VBS VVH analysis places limits on the value of the HHVV coupling between 0.03 and 1.97. 
    Both analyses are based on a proton-proton collision data recorded by the CMS experiment during 2016, 2017, and 2018 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated lumonisity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. 
    In addition, two projects towards the high lumonisity LHC upgrade are described: a highly parallelizable track-finding algorithm and managed networking for large-scale data science.
