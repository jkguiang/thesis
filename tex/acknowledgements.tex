I would like to acknowledge Professor Eta Theta for his support as the
chair of my committee. Through multiple drafts and many long nights,
his guidance has proved to be invaluable.

I would also like to acknowledge the ``Smith Clan'' of lab~28, without
whom my research would have no doubt taken fives times as long. It is
their support that helped me in an immeasureable way.
