Talent is insignificant. I know a lot of talented ruins.\\
Beyond talent lie all the usual words: discipline, love, luck,\\
but, most of all, endurance.

You write with ease to show your breeding,\\
But easy writing's curst hard reading.

\noindent Writing, at its best, is a lonely life. Organizations for
writers palliate the writer's loneliness, but I doubt if they improve
his writing. He grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and
often his work deteriorates. For he does his work alone and if he is a
good enough writer he must face eternity, or the lack of it, each day.
