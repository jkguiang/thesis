\chapter{Another chapter}
The purpose of this page is to illustrate an ordinary page of text in
a doctoral dissertation or master's thesis. All pages of the doctoral
dissertation or master's thesis must be kept within the margins of
1.5'' on the left, 1'' on the right, 1'' on the top and 1.25'' on the
bottom. All text must be double spaced except as indicated below.

It is recommended that to increase the margins as paper can shift in a
printer and as some photocopiers tend to increase the image being
copied.

The first line of each paragraph must be indented at least one 0.5''
tab, as done here.

This text is intended to be a part of the dissertation, for a doctoral
student, or the thesis if you are receiving a master's degree, and now
a quote is included here:
\begin{quote}
All quotes of more than six lines, even though this one is not, are to
be indented 0.5'' from the left and 0.5'' from the right. These longer
quotes are to be single spaced. Don't forget to adjust for proper
spacing after the last line of the quoted material.
\end{quote}
The rest of the paragraph would continue as so.
