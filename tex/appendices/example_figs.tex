\chapter{Figures and Such}
This demonstrates how OGS wants figures and tables formatted. For
figures, the caption goes below the figure and ``Figure'' is in bold.
See Figure~\ref{fig:zen}. Tables are formatted with the caption above
the table. See Table~\ref{tab:bad}.

Of course, Table~\ref{tab:bad} looks horrible. It should probably be
formatted like Table~\ref{tab:good} instead.

For facing caption pages, see Table~\ref{tab:facing}. Of course,
facing caption pages are vaguely ridiculous and my implementation of
them in the class file is by far the most brittle part of the
implementation. It's entirely possible that something has changed and
these don't work at all. I implemented it merely for the challenge.

\emph{Notes}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The counts shown below will differ from the official quarterly
Registrar's registration report because 1) data for residents in the
Schools of Medicine and Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science are
excluded, and 2) registered, non-matriculated, visiting students are
included.
\item Student workers are excluded from employees; however emeritus
faculty and others on recall status are included.
