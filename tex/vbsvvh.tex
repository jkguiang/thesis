\chapter{Measurement of \kVV through VBS VVH production}
\begin{aquote}{Stephen Hawking, The Nature of Space and Time, 1996}
    I take the positivist viewpoint that a physical theory is just a mathematical model and that it is meaningless to ask whether it corresponds to reality. 
    All that one can ask is that its predictions should be in agreement with observation.

        Leading-order Feynman diagrams for VBS production of two vector bosons (V) and one Higgs boson. 
        The HHVV coupling \kVV is denoted by a blue circle (\textcolor{blue}{\ding{108}}), and the HHH coupling \kHHH is denoted by a magenta circle (\textcolor{magenta}{\ding{108}}).

        Leading-order Feynman diagrams for VBS production of two vector bosons (V) and one Higgs boson, where the vector bosons decay hadronically and the Higgs boson decays specifically to b quarks. 
        The HHVV coupling \kVV is denoted by a blue circle (\textcolor{blue}{\ding{108}}), and the HHH coupling \kHHH is denoted by a magenta circle (\textcolor{magenta}{\ding{108}}).
