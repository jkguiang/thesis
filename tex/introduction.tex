\section*{Infinity in the palm of your hand}
This dissertation is based entirely on a simple question: what is everything made of? 
For the vast majority of human history, all answers to this question were equally immaterial, yet for millennia, people with enough time on their hands and food in their bellies have wondered about it---from the Greek philosopher Democritus~\cite{Taylor1419554}, to the Hindu scholar Kan\={a}da (or, ``atom-eater'')~\cite{Margenau}, and probably long before them. 
Over time, philosophical musing transformed into scientific inquiry, and as science progressed, faltered, corrected, and progressed again (and again, and again), patterns began to emerge. 
This evolution is presented here as what David Griffiths would call a ``folk history,'' with inspiration taken heavily from the first chapter of one of his revered textbooks~\cite{GriffithsParticle}.  

In 1808, the chemist John Dalton published the first\footnotemark{} atomic theory~\cite{Dalton1805, Dalton1808}, but the existence of the atom itself could not be directly verified. 
\footnotetext{
    Dalton's now legendary claim to this was hotly contested by his contemporary, William Higgins, although without much credence~\cite{HigginsClaim}.
}
However, nearly a century later, physicists including Henri Becquerel, Marie Curie, and J.J. Thompson found that certain elements and electronic apparatuses emitted different kinds of invisible radiation~\cite{Becquerel, Curie, RADVANYI2017544, Thompson}. 
In the decades following, they further realized that this radiation consisted of tiny particles\footnotemark{}, and Ernest Rutherford directed rays of these particles at thin sheets of metal, probing the subatomic scale for the first time. 
Based on these seminal experiments, Rutherford made a groundbreaking observation and two key deductions: 
\footnotetext{
    Namely photons (X-rays or $\gamma$ rays), electrons ($\beta$ rays), and helium ions (He$^{2+}$ or $\alpha$ rays). 
}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Observation}: The atom exists\footnotemark{} and has a very small ``nucleus'' of positive charge.
    \item \textit{Deduction}: The nucleus is made of positively charged ``protons.''
    \item \textit{Deduction}: The nucleus is also made of ``neutrons'' which help keep it together.
\end{itemize}
\footnotetext{
    It should be noted that Jean Perrin separately confirmed the existence of molecules, and thus reality of atoms, by proving experimentally that the random walk of a microscopic object suspended in liquid could only be due to collisions with the molecules of that liquid~\cite{Perrin}---a phenomenon first observed by the great botanist Robert Brown~\cite{Brown} (i.e. Brownian motion) and rigorously explained by Albert Einstein in one of his first papers~\cite{EinsteinBrownian}.
}
Through their work in the lab, Rutherford, Curie, and the other atomic pioneers had unknowingly stumbled upon the surface of an even greater truth than Democritus, Kan\=ada, or anyone else could have imagined. 

Albert Einstein, Max Planck, Niels Bohr, and others had begun writing down corrections to ``classical'' physics at the turn of the 20\ts{th} century in order to better describe unexplained phenomena observed in the lab~\cite{EinsteinPhotoelectric, Planck, Bohr}. 
By the time Rutherford's neutrons had been discovered by James Chadwick in 1932~\cite{Chadwick1932}, a cadre of theorists, including many of the most well-known physicists in history\footnotemark{}, had formed around Quantum Mechanics.
This ``new physics'' extended the early results of Einstein, Planck, and Bohr into a more complete theory describing the subatomic world, then thought to only include protons, neutrons, and electrons. 
\footnotetext{Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schr\"odinger, and Robert Oppenheimer to name a few.}
Over the next decades, a slew of new particles were discovered: 
anti-matter was produced in the lab; 
electrons were joined by muons and neutrinos in the ``lepton'' family; 
an enormous crowd of more massive particles akin to protons and neutrons were observed (baryons and mesons which together comprise the families of hadrons). 
While some of these particles were already thought to exist, experimental results had, momentarily, outpaced theory. 
Theorists were developing new ideas on how to classify or relate different particles, but the ever-growing ``particle zoo'' was otherwise in disarray. 
However, as is a consistent pattern in history, science progressed, faltered, corrected, and progressed again (and again, and again), and patterns began to emerge. 

\section*{A glorious victory parade}
It began with Murray Gell-Mann, who, among others, saw a pattern in the deluge of new particles being discovered. 
He arranged the numerous hadrons in geometric patterns---octagons, triangles, and so forth---according to their properties~\cite{Gell-Mann:1961omu}, and found that his unusual diagrams held predictive power: some of his shapes were missing vertices, which were later found to be particles exactly matching the expectations from his theory~\cite{PhysRevLett.12.204}. 
With confidence in Gell-Mann's so-called ``Eightfold Way'' established, a natural question arose: what is the significance of these patterns? 
Gell-Mann himself, and, separately, George Zweig, arrived at the answer: hadrons are not themselves fundamental particles; instead, they are composed of truly fundamental particles called ``quarks''~\cite{Lichtenberg:784713}, and the Eightfold Way diagrams corresponded to different configurations of quarks and the properties of those configurations.
Similar to Rutherford's experiments 50 years prior, wherein beams of particles were used to probe the structure of the atom, the reality of quarks could be probed by firing beams of electrons at protons, revealing their inner structure\footnotemark{}~\cite{PhysRevLett.23.930, PhysRevLett.23.935}. 
\footnotetext{These experiments really only showed that the proton had three constituent ``partons,'' but they provided initial evidence for the existence of quarks.}
And so the field progressed, with families of particles filling out into neat organizations: 
the quarks became a family of six, divided into three generations (up/down, charm/strange, top/bottom); 
the leptons, with the addition of the tau and its neutrino, satisfyingly also totaled six particles divided into three generations ($\Pe/\PGne$, $\PGm/\PGnGm$, $\PGt/\PGnGt$); 
the photon was joined by the gluon, \PW, \PZ, and Higgs boson~\cite{ATLASdisc, CMSdisc}, forming the family of bosons. 
At the same time, a beautiful, yet deeply perplexing, quantum field theory was developing, which describes the interactions between these particles. 
In the words of the great Sidney Coleman~\cite{Coleman}:
\begin{quote}
    This was a great time [1966 to 1979] to be a high-energy theorist, the period of the famous triumph of quantum field theory. 
    And what a triumph it was, in the old sense of the word: a glorious victory parade, full of wonderful things brought back from far places to make the spectator gasp with awe and laugh with joy. 
\end{quote}
So began the Standard Model of particle physics: with groundbreaking discoveries and a scientific ``victory parade,'' which together still represent the largest fraction of Nobel Prizes by field~\cite{ParticleNobels}. 

\section*{There and back again}
The Standard Model has, despite remaining largely unchanged since the 1980s, withstood a tremendous amount of scrutiny across decades of intense study and many billions of dollars of scientific instrumentation. 
It supplies, in principle, the answers to those questions posed at the beginning of this chapter: the origins and composition of everything in the universe are explained by the existence of, and interactions between, fundamental particles. 
However, we quickly found that this theory of everything is really only a theory of some things, and long-known errors and inconsistencies---reserved for discussion in the next chapter---have been, much to the community's dismay, just as durable as the Standard Model has been otherwise. 
Particle physics has therefore reached a familiar inflection point, where we are left in anticipation of the next measurement that confirms an unusual approach or the next surprising discovery that leads the theory in an entirely new direction. 
Described in this document are the efforts of one graduate student, along with the invaluable support of his many colleagues, to contribute to this extraordinary enterprise. 
Together, we shall recount his journey, taking the perspective of the ``experimentalist.'' 
That is, very few formulas, axioms, and derivations---the language of theorists---are to be found in this dissertation. 
Instead, we will find tables of measurements, histograms, and some statistics. 
We will take general direction from the theory, then construct experiments to realize it in nature. 

This work is based on the proton-proton collision data collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), a multi-billion dollar particle detector situated on the beamline of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)---the most powerful particle collider and the single largest scientific instrument ever built, at the time of writing. 
At the risk of losing the reader who is not committed to reading the many pages that lie beyond this introduction, no new physics is documented here.
Instead, this humble submission, amongst over one thousand publications from the CMS Collaboration alone, represents a small contribution to the rich history documented above, demonstrating the continued success of a theory that dares to describe the entire universe.
