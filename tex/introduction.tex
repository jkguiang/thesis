% Optional Introduction
\begin{dissertationintroduction}
This optional section is barely described in the OGS manual other than
saying it is optional and that it appears in the table of contents
between the Abstract and the first chapter.

No formatting guidelines appear so presumably, it should be formatted
like an ordinary chapter. It should appear after the
\verb!\mainmatter! macro because it should start on page~1.
