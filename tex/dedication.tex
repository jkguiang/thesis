In recognition of reading this manual before beginning to format the
doctoral dissertation or master's thesis; for following the
instructions written herein; for consulting with OGS Academic Affairs
Advisers; and for not relying on other completed manuscripts, this
manual is dedicated to all graduate students about to complete the
doctoral dissertation or master's thesis.

In recognition that this is my one chance to use whichever
justification, spacing, writing style, text size, and/or textfont that
I want to while still keeping my headings and margins consistent.
