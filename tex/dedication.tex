This dissertation is dedicated to my wife Rosemary and the future we are building together; 
to my parents, Orlando and Cynthia Guiang, and my sister, Christina Guiang; 
to grandpa and grandma, John and Tsuneko Hashiguchi; 
to abuelo and abuela, Rufino and Aurelia Guiang; 
to the thousands of miles traveled, centuries of hardship endured, decades of triumph celebrated, and many wonderous years yet to come. 
I love you all more than words can express.
