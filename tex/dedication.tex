This dissertation is dedicated to my wife Rosemary and the future we are building together; 
to my parents, Orlando and Cynthia Guiang, and my sister, Christina Guiang; 
to grandpa and grandma, John and Tsuneko Hashiguchi; 
to abuelo and abuela, Rufino and Aurelia Guiang; 
to the seas crossed, the hardship, the sacrifices, but also the love, the food, the adventures, and whatever comes next. 


I love you all very much.
